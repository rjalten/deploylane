# deploylane

Just some notes...


Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, AWX, Python, ...

Create a Continuous Delivery lane using containers.

Initial, this parts are intended to be in this configuration:
* Git
* Docker
* Kubernetes (K8s)

* Ansible
* AWX (Ansible Tower)
* Jenkins 2
* Python 3
* Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK)
* Prometheus

## Git
_distributed revision control system_  
Let's presume this Github is the one...

## Jenkins 2
_automation server with an unparalleled plugin ecosystem to support practically every tool as part of your delivery pipelines_  
* Err...

## Docker
_software technology providing containers_  
* Install docker, as explained at the Docker site
* Gosh...

## K8s
_system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications_  
* Now...

## Ansible
_automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment_  
* So...

## AWX
_upstream project for Red Hat Ansible Tower. GUI and REST API for managing both cloud-based and traditional/hybrid Ansible deployments_  
* Thus...

## Jenkins 2
_automation server with an unparalleled plugin ecosystem to support practically every tool as part of your delivery pipelines_  
* Hmm...

## Python
_widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum_  
* Install Python3.x from python.org

## ELK
_ELK stack. Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana are a bundle of technologies that combine into a very powerful time-series analytics platform_  
_Elasticsearch: search engine based on Lucene_  
_Logstash: tool for managing events and logs_  
_Kibana: data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch_  
* Ow...
